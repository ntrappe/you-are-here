## I. Introduction
### Purpose
This guide will help you navigate the PhD application process.

## II. Choosing a PhD or Master's
### Differences
| Aspect | PhD | Master's |
| ------- | ---- | --------- |
| Duration | 3-7 years | 1-2 years |
| Research Focus | Extensive, original research | Specialized course work |
| Career Goals | Academia, research, teaching | Industry, professional roles |
| Financial Support | Often fully funded | Funding may very |
| Thesis/Dissertation | Extensive, in-depth thesis | Smaller research project |

### Assessing Goals
- Consider your long-term career aspiration and how each degree aligns with them. 
- If you are passionate about research, want to teach at the university level, or desire a career in academia, aim for a PhD. 
- If your career goals are in a specific field that values practical skills and knowledge over research, a Master's might be sufficient. 

## III. Identifying Your Research Area
- Start with your interests and passions _(research is a long and demanding so pick something you love)_ 
- Reflect on the subjects or topics you excelled in during your studies.
- Seek guidance from professors, mentors, advisors, and friends.
- Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) to explore academic journals, books, or articles related to your field and see which areas have research potential.
- Make use of tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to identify gaps in research.

## IV. Selecting Suitable Schools
- Investigate a multitude of universities and programs.
- Consider factors like location, cost of living, reputation, funding, etc. 
- Create a list of potential schools that align with your interests. 
- Narrow the list down to 2-3 domestic schools or 4-6 including international.

### Example Criteria
| Criteria | Considerations |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Location | Proximity to home, climate, urban/rural |
| Degree | PhD, PsyD, EdD, MsRc, etc. |
| GPA | Check the program's minimum GPA requirements |
| Exams | Check if the program requires GREs, GMATs, GCSEs, etc. |
| Length | Duration of the PhD program |
| Funding | Availability of stipends, scholarships, teaching/research assistantships |

### Interviews
I'd highly recommend reaching out to 2-3 graduate students who are in your desired program at these different schools. Grad students will often tell you the truth about a program, filter your criteria, and help you get a feel for the school. Find grad students by going through labs directories for that school. You can DM them on LinkedIn.

```html
Hi! This is totally random but I’m considering <school> for my PhD in <area>. 
I found your name on one of the directories and I wanted to learn more about your experiences as a current student. 
Would you be down for a virtual coffee chat or LinkedIn chat?
Thanks and lmk!
```

## V. Preparing Application Artifacts
### Transcripts
Request official transcripts and double-check that the transcript you've ordered meets the schools' requirements. _(Note that ordering transcripts can cost between $100-200)._

### Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume
You'll likely be asked to submit a CV to highlight your research experience, publications, posters, and general academic accomplishments. If you've never written one before, check this [CV guide](https://grad.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/cvsamples.pdf). If you have yet to publish a paper, but you have submitted, you can list it as a "Manuscript Under Review".

| Aspect | Resume | CV |
| ------- | -------- | --- |
| Length | Typically 1-2 pages | Can be extensive, multiple pages |
| Focus | Concise summary of work experience and skills | Comprehensive academic and work history |
| Purpose | Tailored for job applications | Used for academic, research, and teaching positions |
| Sections | Summary, Education, Work Experience, Skills | Education, Research, Publications, Awards, Teaching, Professional Memberships |

### Standardized Tests
Prepare for GRE/GMAT/GCSE (if necessary) and send scores to school. If your school doesn't require it and you had decent grades, don't bother. If you feel the need to prove your growth from year 1 to now, take them. If they're optional, make sure you've studied for them because schools can see every instance you've taken the exam, regardless of whether you submit that score.

### English Proficiency
Prepare for TOEFL/IELTS (if applicable) and forward scores to schools.

### Statements
I'd highly recommend reading ["A Field Guide to Grad School"](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691201092/a-field-guide-to-grad-school) and ["Graduate Admissions Essays"](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/graduate-admissions-essays-write-your-way-into-the-graduate-school-of-your-choice-graduate-admissions-essays_donald-asher/268997/#edition=6859437&idiq=7561054) for examples and suggestions. Think of these statements as a way to connect all the pieces of your application and put together a compelling case for why you should be in research.

### Letters of Recommendation
Choose recommenders wisely, ensure that they'll be _very_ positive and enthusiastic. Provide them with your CV, transcript, coursework, and PhD goals.

```html
Subject: Recommendation for <Name>
```
```html
Hi,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to ask for a favor. I’m in the process of applying for PhD programs in <field> and I’d like to ask if you’re comfortable with writing me a letter of recommendation. I'm applying to <list of schools> and I'd like to submit my applications by <deadline>.

Since it’s been a while since we’ve caught up, would you be available for a brief 15-30m call? <Provide your availability> I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts on which skills or experiences of mine would be beneficial to include.

<Add a personal note or anecdote>

Please let me know if you’re available for a call sometime in the next couple of weeks. I’m quite flexible and can work around your schedule. I truly appreciate your time and help.

Thanks,
<Your Name>
```

## VI. Contact Potential Supervisors
### Faculty Fit
- Understand what your own needs and requirements first: cadence of meetings, management style, lab size, time commitment, methods, etc.
- Align with a potential supervisor to ensure that you'll receive the support you need and that you're the type of student they can take on.
- Your supervisor will make or break your PhD so be very selective.

### Finding Supervisors
- Explore faculty profiles on university websites.
- Ask current grad students about their experiences and recommendations.
- Identify the supervisors for your favorite papers.

### Getting a Supervisor
- Make a list of 2-3 supervisors per schools and explain why that lab would interest you.
- Read 1-2 papers from each lab to be up to date with their research.
- Write a concise, polite, well-researched emails to initiate contact.
- Ensure that they are taking new students.

## VII. The Application Process
### Deadlines
Note application deadlines and submission methods. Stick deadlines on your calendar and send invites to those writing your recommendation letters. Give yourself a few days before the deadline to request transcripts or letters.

### Fees
Applications can run from $70-200. If applicable, apply for fee waivers or email the department for support.

### Submission
Ensure that you have 100% submitted the application. Check that your faculty have also submitted their letters at least 2-3 letters prior to your deadline. Try to submit applications days ahead of the official deadline for processing, errors, or accidents.

## VIII. Application Review
### Waiting
Notifications of acceptance range from 1-3 months post submission. 

### Interviews
If interviews are part of the process, prepare by studying the program, your potential fit, and the research you want to present. Interviews often occur in the middle of January and February. If you are asked to interview, you're 80% of the way there.

### Visits
Attend open days and campus visits. Be prepared to meet with potential faculty members and surface questions about research, your interests, and many other topics. ["A Field Guide to Grad School"](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691201092/a-field-guide-to-grad-school) has a helpful section on this.
