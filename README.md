| _I should already know where I'm going._ | _You can't know where you are going until you know where you are._ | `17` | [^1] |
| _Work is not supposed to be enjoyable._ | _Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you._ | `42` | [^2] |
| _I'm stuck._ | _I'm never stuck, because I can always generate a lot of ideas._ | `64` | [^3] |
| _I have to find the one right idea._ | _I need a lot of ideas so that I can explore any number of possibilities for my future._ | `65` | [^4] |
| _If I comprehensively research the best data for all aspects of my plan, I'll be fine._ | _I should build prototypes to explore questions about my alternatives._ | `111` | [^5] |
| _My dream job is out there waiting._ | _You design your dream job through the process of actively seeking and co-creating it._ | `145` | [^6] |

[^1]: Wayfinders aren't focused on maintaining course in a straight line. They know when to adjust their current course to follow the North Star.
[^2]: Identify what exercises kept you engaged, gave you energy, and tapped into your flow state. That's what you enjoy.
[^3]: Good designers _always_ focus on quantity over quality. Explore many ideas in parallel so you don't
get trapped into validating a single idea.
[^4]: It's not about finding the _right_ idea but choosing well. There can often be a number of good solutions.
[^5]: Designers don't pontificate over an idea, they test it out.
[^6]: Aim to break into the hidden job market and seek out what you want. Don't rely on existing job openinings on the Internet.
[^7]: If someone asks for directions, what do you do? You'll probably give directions if you can. You'll help them and you don't expect to see them again or get anything in return. Networking is the same.
